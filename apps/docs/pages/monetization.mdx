## Fee Structure

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Fees are subject to change during the testnet phase.
    STX fees will be replaced with sBTC fees in the future.
</Callout>

On each collect the reader pays a protcol fee of 1 STX, distributed in the following way:

- 0.5 STX → Writer
- 0.35 STX → Platform
- 0.15 STX → Referral (optional)

The 1 STX protocol fee applies to every collect, whether free or paid. When you set a price for your post, you receive 100% of that amount plus your share of the protocol fee.

## Curators

Curators are responsible for promoting quality content and helping readers discover and support writers' work. They receive a share of the fees collected from readers.

Curators can either be individuals sharing posts, or developers building on top of Sigle.
