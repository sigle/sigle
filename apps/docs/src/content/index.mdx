# What is Sigle?

Sigle is a secured and open-source writing platform for web3 content creators, NFT projects, crypto analysts and more.

## How it works

On Sigle, each published post is its own NFT collection, offering readers a way to own and support writers' work. When creating a post, writers decide its collection parameters: make it free or set a price in Bitcoin, choose between a limited edition that creates scarcity or keep it open for unlimited collecting. Each time someone collects a post using sBTC, the payment automatically splits between the creator, curators who help discover and promote quality content, and the protocol to sustain the platform's development.

## Testnet

Sigle is currently in a public testnet, anyone can create posts, collect them and use the SDK and API to integrate or interact with the protocol.

You can find the testnet at [testnet.sigle.io](https://testnet.sigle.io).
